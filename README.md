# Jenkins Pipeline Library
> Personal utility library for writing jenkins pipelines 

This is a small project aimed to ease the creation of Jenkins pipelines by defining a common set of operation.
This library is intended to be used as a [shared pipeline library](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/)
and not a Jenkins plugin.
